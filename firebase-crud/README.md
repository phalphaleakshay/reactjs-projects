# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is created with the help of React and Firebase.

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `Use of Firebase DB to save and retrieve data`

In project, `firebase.js` file contains configuration to persist data on firebase cloud.
You just need to create database instance using firebase. After that, it will provide one
configuration object. Copy that configuration object in `firebase.js` and run app using 
`npm start`.
